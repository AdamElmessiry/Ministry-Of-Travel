        The Ministry of Travel is committed to guiding Egypt toward a brighter future in tourism, culture,

      <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom border-3 border-primary pb-2 mb-3">Tourism Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Tourism is one of Egypt’s most vital sectors, and our goal is to steadily increase the number of
        visitors each year by enhancing infrastructure, improving services, and promoting Egypt’s diverse
        attractions. We aim to highlight not only ancient monuments but also modern experiences, from
        luxury resorts on the Red Sea to desert adventures and cultural festivals.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2030, the ministry seeks to position Egypt as one of the top five global destinations for cultural
        and historical tourism.

      <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom border-3 border-primary pb-2 mb-3">Cultural Preservation</h2>
      <p>
        Egypt’s cultural and archaeological heritage is unmatched, and preserving it is at the heart of our
        mission. We are committed to protecting ancient monuments, temples, mosques, churches, and traditional
        crafts through restoration programs, digital documentation, and international collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protecting intangible heritage, such as music, folklore, and local traditions, ensures that Egypt’s
        living culture continues to thrive alongside its monuments.

    <section class="card glass-card p-4 mb-5 shadow-lg border-0">
      <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom border-3 border-primary pb-2 mb-3">Sustainability</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable tourism is a core priority. We aim to minimize environmental impacts while maximizing
        benefits for local communities. This includes supporting eco-friendly hotels, protecting marine life
        in the Red Sea, and introducing green transportation options for tourists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to ensure that Egypt’s natural and cultural treasures can be enjoyed responsibly by
        both present and future generations.

      <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom border-3 border-primary pb-2 mb-3">International Relations</h2>
      <p>
        The Ministry seeks to strengthen Egypt’s position on the global stage through tourism diplomacy.
        By building partnerships with countries around the world, we aim to increase cultural exchanges,
        promote Egypt as a safe and welcoming destination, and encourage collaborative research in
        archaeology and heritage preservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Egypt aspires to become a global leader in intercultural dialogue and heritage protection.

    <!-- Economic Development -->
    <section class="card glass-card p-4 mb-5 shadow-lg border-0">
      <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom border-3 border-primary pb-2 mb-3">Economic Development</h2>
      <p>
        Tourism contributes significantly to Egypt’s economy, and our goal is to expand this contribution
        by diversifying tourist experiences. From luxury travel to budget-friendly adventures, Egypt
        seeks to attract a wide variety of visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through job creation, investment in local businesses, and the development of modern facilities,
        tourism will continue to support Egypt’s economic growth and empower communities across the country.
