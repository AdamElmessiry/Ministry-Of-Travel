      <p class="lead">
        Port Said Governorate sits at the northern entrance of the Suez Canal, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.
        Founded in 1859 during the canal’s construction, it has grown into an important port city and free trade zone.
        The governorate is famous for its maritime history, cosmopolitan culture, and unique mix of Egyptian and European architecture.

      <p class="lead">
        Port Said is about 200 km northeast of Cairo and is accessible by road or train.
        The best time to visit is between October and April, when the coastal weather is mild.
        Travelers often combine visits to Port Said with Ismailia and Port Fouad, which is reached by ferry across the canal.
        The city’s free zone is also popular for shopping and trade.
