      <p>
        Ancient Egypt is one of the most iconic civilizations in human history, flourishing along the fertile
        banks of the Nile River for over three millennia. Its history is generally divided into three main
        kingdoms — the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and New Kingdom — each marked by extraordinary cultural,
        political, and technological advancements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) is famously remembered as the “Age of the Pyramids.”
        During this era, the great pyramids of Giza were constructed, serving as monumental tombs for the
        pharaohs. The pharaoh was regarded as both a political ruler and a divine figure, linking the
        people to the gods. This strong central authority enabled the coordination of massive building
        projects that still inspire awe today.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE) was a period of political stability and artistic achievement.
        Literature, philosophy, and religious practices flourished, and Egypt expanded its trade and
        influence beyond its borders. This was also a time when common people gained more access to
        religious practices that were previously reserved for the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
        The New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE) is often considered the golden age of Egypt. It was during this
        period that Egypt expanded its empire, with rulers like Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, and
        Ramses II leaving an indelible mark on history. Monumental temples at Karnak and Luxor, richly
        decorated tombs in the Valley of the Kings, and advances in art and science highlight this era.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ancient Egypt contributed immensely to human knowledge: hieroglyphic writing, early forms of
        medicine, mathematics, and monumental architecture. Its legacy continues to shape our understanding
        of civilization itself.

    <!-- Greco-Roman Period -->

      <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom border-3 border-primary pb-2 mb-3">Greco-Roman Period</h2>
      <p>
        In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt and founded the city of Alexandria, which would soon
        become one of the most influential cultural centers in the ancient world. Under the Ptolemaic dynasty,
        Greek and Egyptian traditions blended, giving rise to a rich cultural and intellectual environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Library of Alexandria, although now lost to history, was said to have contained hundreds of
        thousands of manuscripts and represented the greatest collection of knowledge in the ancient world.
        Scholars from across the Mediterranean traveled to Egypt to study science, philosophy, literature,
        and mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Egypt eventually came under Roman rule in 30 BCE after the famous defeat of Queen Cleopatra VII and
        Mark Antony. The Roman period saw Egypt serve as the “breadbasket” of the empire, providing much of
        its grain supply. During this time, Roman architecture merged with Egyptian traditions, and cities
        like Alexandria continued to thrive as cosmopolitan hubs.

    <!-- Islamic Egypt -->

      <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom border-3 border-primary pb-2 mb-3">Islamic Egypt</h2>
      <p>
        With the Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 CE, a new chapter in Egyptian history began. Cairo was founded
        in 969 CE by the Fatimid dynasty and quickly grew into one of the most important cities in the Islamic
        world. Known as “The City of a Thousand Minarets,” Cairo became a center for religious scholarship,
        trade, and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Islamic era in Egypt was marked by the construction of magnificent mosques, madrasas (schools),
        and fortresses. The Al-Azhar Mosque, founded in 970 CE, evolved into one of the oldest and most
        prestigious universities in the world, continuing to serve as a beacon of Islamic scholarship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Egypt’s role as a crossroads of trade routes further enriched its culture. Goods, ideas, and people
        moved through the bustling markets of Cairo, linking Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Even today,
        the legacy of Islamic architecture and culture shapes the identity of Egypt.

    <!-- Modern Egypt -->
    <section class="card glass-card p-4 mb-5 shadow-lg border-0">
      <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom border-3 border-primary pb-2 mb-3">Modern Egypt</h2>
      <p>
        The 19th and 20th centuries were transformative periods for Egypt. In 1869, the opening of the Suez
        Canal connected the Mediterranean and Red Seas, revolutionizing global trade. This project highlighted
        Egypt’s geopolitical importance and drew the attention of European powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the late 19th century, Egypt was under British control, and the struggle for independence became
        a defining aspect of its modern history. Egypt gained nominal independence in 1922, but full
        sovereignty was achieved only after the 1952 revolution, which ended the monarchy and established
        a republic under Gamal Abdel Nasser.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 20th century, Egypt played a central role in the Arab world, hosting important political
        movements and influencing regional affairs. The construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s
        symbolized modernization efforts, bringing hydroelectric power and improved irrigation but also
        changing the natural flooding cycle of the Nile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Egypt is a modern nation that blends its ancient heritage with contemporary development.
        Tourism continues to be a cornerstone of its economy, as millions of people from around the world
        visit the pyramids, temples, tombs, and vibrant cities. At the same time, Egypt continues to invest
        in infrastructure, culture, and education to shape its future.
