        <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">The Deserts of Egypt</h2>
        <p>
          Egypt’s deserts cover more than 90% of the country, shaping its geography, culture, and way of life. 
          These vast landscapes are not only a natural wonder but also an essential part of Egypt’s history, 
          heritage, and tourism. From the golden sands of the Sahara to the rugged mountains of Sinai, the deserts 
          of Egypt continue to inspire explorers, travelers, and locals alike.

        <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">The Western Desert</h2>
        <p>
          The Western Desert is part of the great Sahara, stretching across most of Egypt’s land area. 
          It is home to extraordinary natural features such as the White Desert, with its surreal chalk formations, 
          and the Black Desert, marked by volcanic hills and dark stones. The Western Desert also contains 
          fertile oases such as Siwa, Bahariya, Farafra, Dakhla, and Kharga, which have supported human life 
          for thousands of years.

        <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">The Eastern Desert</h2>
        <p>
          Located between the Nile River and the Red Sea, the Eastern Desert is a rugged land of mountains, 
          wadis (dry riverbeds), and rich mineral deposits. Historically, it served as a vital route for 
          ancient trade and mining, supplying precious stones and gold to the Pharaohs. Today, it is 
          admired for its natural beauty and desert safaris.

        <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">The Sinai Desert</h2>
        <p>
          The Sinai Desert combines majestic mountains, sacred sites, and stunning coastal landscapes. 
          Mount Sinai is a place of immense spiritual significance, while the desert valleys and Bedouin 
          communities showcase traditions that have endured for centuries. The region also offers modern 
          attractions, with world-famous resorts along the Red Sea coast.

        <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">The Importance of Egypt’s Deserts</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond their natural beauty, Egypt’s deserts are sources of cultural heritage, economic opportunity, 
          and adventure tourism. They are destinations for explorers, photographers, historians, and spiritual 
          travelers seeking peace and discovery. Protecting these fragile environments is essential to 
          ensuring their legacy for future generations.
